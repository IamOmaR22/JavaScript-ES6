$ npm init -y

$ code .

$ npm install --save-dev babel-core babel-preset-env

Create a new file called .babelrc

$ npm install --save-dev webpack babel-loader

$ npm install --save-dev webpack-cli -D

Create a new folder called src and Inside src folder create a file called index.js 

Create a new file called webpack.config.js

Then go to package.json file and remove the test from scripts. Added dev and build inside scripts.

$ npm run dev



Additional [If error occurs]

$ npm install -D babel-loader @babel/core @babel/preset-env webpack

npm install --save-dev @babel/core @babel/preset-env

npm install --save-dev babel-core babel-preset-env

npm install @babel/core --save

$ npm run dev   // This command will compile the code to run on browser.



// -- // Setup Webpack Dev Server [ After doing this no need to apply npm run dev every time ] // -- //

$ npm install -D webpack-dev-server         or        npm install --save-dev webpack-dev-server

Then add start scripts inside the package.json file. After that we can open our dev server by using npm start.

Then add a new line inside the webpack.config.js file for declare the publicPath. After that we can remove the dist folder.

In package.json file and Inside "scripts": { }, ==>
                                                    
    "start": "webpack serve --mode development"             -- Use this for start the webpack server. It will give you a port http://localhost:8080/

    "start": "webpack serve --open --mode development"      -- Use this for start and open the webpack server. It will give you a port and directly open on the browser.

$ npm start

We need to import the file which i exported to use.
